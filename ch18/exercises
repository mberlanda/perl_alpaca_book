Modify the RaceHorse class to get the previous standings from persistent
storage (e.g., DBM, Storable , JSON , and so on) when the horse is created,
and update the standings when the horse is destroyed.

For example, running this program four times:
  my $runner = RaceHorse->named('Billy Boy');
  $runner->won;
  print $runner->name, ' has standings ', $runner->standings, ".\n";
should show four additional wins. Make sure that a RaceHorse still does everything
a normal Horse does otherwise.
