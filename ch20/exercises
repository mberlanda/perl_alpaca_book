Use the Test::File module to check for the existence and readability
of the /etc/hosts file on Unix and the C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file on
Windows (or, if you donâ€™t have those files, choose one you do have). Skip the test
for the platform you are not on by inspecting the value of $^O (capital O) variable.
You can add this test file to your distribution for My::List::Util or use it as a
standalone program.

  /My-List-Util $ perl -t t/hosts.t


=head2 Ex 02
Write your own test module ( Test::My::List::Util ), that has a single
test function ( sum_ok ), which takes two arguments: the actual sum and the expected
sum. Print a diagnostic message if the two do not match:
  my $sum = sum( 2, 2 );
  sum_ok( $sum, 4, 'The sums match' );
Besides the example in this chapter, you can also look at the source for
Test::File (or most other Test::* modules) to get ideas for your module.

  /My-List-Util $ perl -t -Ilib t/sum.t
