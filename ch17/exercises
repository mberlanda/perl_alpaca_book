=head2 ch17 Exercises

=head1 Ex 01
Take the Oogaboogoo library you created in Chapter 11, Exercise 1,
and turn it into a module you can bring in with use . Alter the invoking code so that
it uses the imported routines (rather than the full package specification as you did
before), and test it.

  $ cd ch17
  $ perl -t -Ilib oogabooogoo.t

=head Ex 02
Modify your answer to Exercise 1 to use an export tag named “all”.
When the user uses “all”, your module should import all subroutine names:
use Oogaboogoo::date qw(:all);

  $ perl -t -Ilib oogabooogoo.t

=head Ex 03
Modify the My::List::Util module you created in Chapter 14 so it
exports its sum and shuffle .

  $ cd My-List-Util/
  $ ./Build test
