Give the Animal class the ability to get and set the name and color. Be
sure that your result works under use strict . Also make sure your get methods
work with both a generic animal and a specific animal instance. Test your work
with:

  my $tv_horse = Horse->named('Mr. Ed');
  $tv_horse->set_name('Mister Ed');
  $tv_horse->set_color('grey');
  print $tv_horse->name, ' is ', $tv_horse->color, "\n";
  print Sheep->name, ' colored ', Sheep->color, ' goes ', Sheep->sound, "\n";

What should you do if youâ€™re asked to set the name or color of a generic animal?
