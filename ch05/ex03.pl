Starting with your data structure from Exercise 2, rewrite the
coconet.dat file so that itâ€™s in the same format, but sorted by source machine. Report
each destination machine once per source machine along with total bytes trans-
ferred. The destination machines should be indented under the source machine
name and be sorted by the machine name:
  ginger.hut
    maryann.hut 13744
  professor.hut
    gilligan.hut 1845
    maryann.hut 90
  thurston.howell.hut
    lovey.howell.hut 97560

my %total_bytes;
while(<>) {
  next if /^#/;
  my ($source, $destination, $bytes) = split;
  $total_bytes{$source}{$destination} += $bytes;
}
for my $source (sort keys %total_bytes) {
  say $source;
  my $tb = $total_bytes{$source};
  foreach(sort keys %$tb) {
    say "  $_ $tb->{$_}";
  }
}
