Make a program that uses your library and the following code to print
out a message, such as Today is dip sen 15 2011 , meaning that today is a Monday
in August. You might use localtime :
  my($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday) = localtime;
Hint: The year and month numbers returned by localtime may not be what youâ€™d
expect, so you need to check the documentation.
